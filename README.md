## **Inspiration**

The game is a mimic of the Simon game in real life, whatever the host says we follow. Also Simon game is a good practice for callback functions since the logistics of the game contains numerous callback functions with loop. And who doesn’t like loop statement right?

## **What it does**

Get ready to observe, recall, and repeat! The Simon game is an electrical light and sound game in which players must correctly press the coloured pads to repeat random light sequences. It is a fast-paced game with challenging lighting and sounds. As you repeat the patterns and move up levels. 

### Repeat

It’s a repeat pattern game, with each element need to be match every time the game at the next level. The game will release one random element at a time.

### Match whole sequence 

When the pattern released new element it will not replay anymore but stored in an array, which the user need to matched it from the beginning of the pattern not only the last one,
